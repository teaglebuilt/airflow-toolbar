Airflow plugin for enhancing development with Apache Airflow. This is currently in development. I intend to have this tool resemble 
***[Flask Debug Toolbar](https://flask-debugtoolbar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)***.

Since Airflow is built on top of Flask and Gunicorn, I intend to cover all of the related functionality from ***[Flask Debug Toolbar](https://flask-debugtoolbar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)*** and extending it with the capabilities of monitoring | debugging ***[Apache Airflow](https://github.com/apache/airflow)***.
